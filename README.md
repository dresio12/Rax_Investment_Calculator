# Rax_Investment_Calculator

A small project building a shiny application that performs a number of calculations pertaining to the Real sports mobile app. The virtual currency in the app, rax, can be used to buy Player and Team cards, sometimes referred to as "passes". Additionally, you can use rax to buy packs of play rating cards (and for some sports, individual cards) to upgrade your Player and Team passes. There are three main types of packs a user can buy: General (200 rax for 6 play rating cards and a booster), Starter (100 rax for 3 play rating cards and 1 booster), and Yesterday packs (250 rax for 5 play rating cards of players that played the previous day). Player and Team passes earn rax depending on quality of performance, which the user then uses to invest in more passes or into card packs.

This app calculates how much rax needs to be invested into Player and Team passes to reach each rarity level in an attempt to identify which pass rarities provide the best value for your investment. The calculator is an estimation, as I do not have the average sum of play rating card values for each type of pack, but the user can test different values. They can also input the initial Player and Team card rax costs, choose the type of pack, and choose the target rarity to see how many packs must be bought and for how much rax. 

Also included is a table that shows the net profit a user can expect from On This Day (OTD) rax -  a feature that allows a user to continue collecting rax from player performances on the same date in the years following that performance, up to a maximum cap.
